# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Time Series Forecasting

This project analyzes and forecasts stock market trends using Time Series techniques such as **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **LSTM**. The goal is to understand historical patterns, identify trends, and make short-term predictions for stock prices.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Forecasting Models: ARIMA (Statsmodels), Prophet (Meta), LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras)
- (Optional) Deployment: Streamlit

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing (Yahoo Finance CSV)
2. EDA & Visualization of Trends & Seasonality
3. Forecasting using:
    - ARIMA
    - Prophet
    - LSTM Neural Network
4. Model Evaluation & Metrics (RMSE, MAE)
5. Interactive Forecast Visualization (Plotly)
6. (Optional) Web Demo Deployment using Streamlit
